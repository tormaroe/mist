![MIST](https://github.com/tormaroe/mist/blob/master/gfx/logo.png?raw=true)

**MIST** is a general purpose, dynamic, functional programming language, and is a member of the Lisp family. It runs on the CLR / .Net Framework, and the high-level interpreter is implemented in C#. It does *not* use the DLR.

MIST can be used in several ways:

* Evaluate code directly in the interactive REPL
* Run MIST scripts by passing them to or loading them in the REPL
* Embed the interpreter in your .Net program to execute MIST scripts as part of your solution
* Create executable, standalone programs using the MISTPACKER tool

MIST is in early alpha, and is just to be used as a toy for now!
