![MIST](https://github.com/tormaroe/mist/blob/master/gfx/logo.png?raw=true)

**MIST** is a general purpose, dynamic, functional programming language, and is a member of the Lisp family. It runs on the CLR / .Net Framework on a high-level interpreter implemented in C#. Note that it does *not* use the DLR.

MIST can be used in several ways:

* Evaluate code directly in the interactive MIST REPL
* Run MIST files by passing them to or loading them in the REPL
* Embed the interpreter in your .Net program to execute MIST code as part of your solution
* Create executable, standalone programs using the MISTPACKER tool

MIST is in early alpha, and should be considered an experiment for now!
